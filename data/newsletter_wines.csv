September 2017 Newsletter,Domaine Sigalas Santorini Assyrtiko 2016,,['95'],"(6/2017) ""The 2016 Assyrtiko is unoaked and comes in at 14% alcohol. One of the island's benchmarks, this is always in fine form these day-and always rather hard to evaluate when it is young. Deceptively, this bottling doesn't seem intimidating on first taste, but it always hides many layers. I tend to decant them or taste them again the next day when they are young. Otherwise, you tend to miss too much. Wonderfully elegant and finishing with a salty nuance, this shows impeccable balance. Its best feature is the lingering and intense finish, with plenty of tension and grip. It has far more power than it seems on a casual sip and that power doesn't go away as the wine airs and warms. I tried it the next day, in fact, and it put on weight, absorbed the salt and showed even more power. Two days later, it still preened in its power and precision, fresh as a daisy and wholly unevolved. (The salt was back, too.) The gripping finish that coated the palate was simply impressive. This is another beauty from Sigalas, something that has a lot of upside potential still. Granting that I do not have them side by side, this might even be superior to the 2015. It's hard to overlook the superlative combination of concentration and intensity. If nothing else, it is a worthy competitor to the 2015 and fully its equal. While I am leaning up on it today, it is all about the potential as not many whites are this tightly wound. Try this again at the beginning summer 2019, and you will no doubt have a better experience. You can dive in now, if you insist, but I suspect this may not be fully expressive until 2020 or so. It should also age effortlessly, but let's start here and take the rest in stages. I won't be shocked if handles 20 years or more well, but let's be conservative for the moment.""",25.99,https://vinchicago.com/wines/6211-detail

It is one of the more aromatic wines I've had from Ameal. It is fun to just smell in its youth, very floral and almost exotic. It is also remarkably powerful. If it seemed quite nice on the first day, then on the second day the big acidic core took over, a hint of herbs popped up and it became even more powerful. The fine tension on the finish allows the fruit to linger and grip the palate. The juicy finish can make you drool. Reasonable in body for the grape, which in some years is more on the ethereal side, it seems multilayered, transparent and bursting with controlled flavor. As good as it was on the first two days, it seemed like the essence of Loureiro on the third day. As much as I preferred the library versions this issue for drinking now, here is an example of how delicious and exciting they can be when young, too. In that regard, this is built to age and we might have to wait a few years to be sure how truly great it is. If you don't know top-end Vinho Verde and Ameal, you may be shocked at that. This will become more complex and (I suspect) flesh out over the next few years. It is, if anything, a bit too aggressive just now. You get this amazing value only because owner Pedro Araújo labors in Vinho Verde, where the top wines are undervalued. Take advantage.

It comes in a striking package - a super hip ""squat"" 1-Liter bottle. So, what's in the bottle? It's based on Alicante Nero, also known as Grenache (yes, Grenache in Tuscany!), blended with smaller percentages of Carignan, Mourvedre and Alicante Bouschet. The nose is super juicy and fresh, with pure red fruit tones of black raspberry, black cherry and cassis. Secondary notes of pepper, grainy red earth, sweet herbs and hints of barnyard add further complexity and tons of character. The wine has a wonderfully elegant texture, similar to a great Pinot Noir. ""Unlitro"" is drinkable by itself and with pretty much any pairing you can think of. With modest alcohol and bright structure, it is super versatile.

Simply put, this is an outrageously beautiful wine for the money. In most vintages, the Langhe Nebbiolo is a combination of fruit from Vajra's estate in Sinio (more on that in a bit) plus declassified lots of the Barolos. In 2014, most of the fruit is from the Sinio property. If you ask old-timers (you have to go back 1-2 generations), grapes from Sinio were often used for the production of Barolo. The fruit sees a short fermentation in steel meant to emphasize freshness, but I have no doubt that if the Vajras wanted to, they could make a Barolo-level wine from this fruit.

Vajra ""Albe"" Barolo 2013",,"['92', '93', '93']","(2/2017) ""Vajra's 2013 Barolo Albe is beautifully perfumed, sensual and expressive in this vintage, with a bit less overt fruit and more aromatic/structural intensity than is often the case. The style of the Albe has always favored a more succulent expression of Nebbiolo that is quite different from the single-vineyard wines, but the 2013 suggests Vajra may be moving the Albe closer in line stylistically to their other Barolos, which I think is a positive. In any event, there is an element of restraint in the 2013 that is hugely appealing. The Albe is a blend of fruit from Fossati, Coste di Vergne and La Volta aged in 75 hectoliter casks. The Albe may be the single best value in Barolo today. As for the 2013, don't miss it!""",32.99,https://vinchicago.com/wines/6534-detail

December 2017 Newsletter,Bodegas Aster Ribera del Duero Crianza 2012,,['91'],"(12/2017) La Rioja Alta is one of the great producers in Rioja. Bodegas Aster is their estate in Ribera del Duero. While it is a Crianza, matured for one year in barrel, the focus here is on the pure black cherry of the Tempranillo grape. All about the fruit, the 2015 Aster is clean and bright, medium-to-full in body and softly textured with an ever so slight earth and mild vanilla character. A beautiful dry red to pair with red meat and stews. Think pot roast.",14.99,https://vinchicago.com/wines/6545-detail
December 2017 Newsletter,Joh. Bapt.Schafer Dorsheim Riesling Trocken 2015,"Wine Advocate quotes a release price of $33-39 for this dry, ageworthy Nahe estate-grown Riesling. We're selling it for less than half that amount!",['89'],"(12/30/2016) The 2015 Dorsheim Riesling Trocken is sourced in the Grosse Lage vineyards Pittermännchen (60%) and Goldloch (40%) but from younger vines and less well exposed rows. Macerated between eight to 12 hours, the wine fermented partly in stainless steel and partly in 1,200-liter oak Stück. It opens with a delicately fruity, stony, initially a bit reductive, yet intense nose with pineapples flavors. Full-flavored, very juicy and piquant, this is a very elegant and well balanced Riesling with grip and bitter grapefruit flavors in the finish. This is surely a wine to be kept for 3-8 or even 10 years. Drink Date 2019 - 2026.""",14.99,https://vinchicago.com/wines/6551-detail

Smoking good notes of cassis, black currants and hints of plum all emerge from this rich, beautifully textured, layered beauty that has solid tannic grip, a silky, elegant texture and a great finish.

Lively, fruit-driven scents of strawberry, raspberry and flowers; I might have picked this blind as Pinot from the nose. Conveys a touch of sweetness but lovely acidity frames the wine's lively red berry and cherry fruit flavors. Not the most refined mousse but easy to drink, and with good backbone and acidity. Finishes with a touch of mineral firmness and very good length.
