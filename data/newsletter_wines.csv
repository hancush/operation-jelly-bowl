Instead, the quality of fruit is vibrant and rich. This is a healthy, generous and exuberant Brunello with dark density and succulent fruit flavors that are followed by integrated spice and tobacco.

It is one of the more aromatic wines I've had from Ameal. It is fun to just smell in its youth, very floral and almost exotic. It is also remarkably powerful. If it seemed quite nice on the first day, then on the second day the big acidic core took over, a hint of herbs popped up and it became even more powerful. The fine tension on the finish allows the fruit to linger and grip the palate. The juicy finish can make you drool. Reasonable in body for the grape, which in some years is more on the ethereal side, it seems multilayered, transparent and bursting with controlled flavor. As good as it was on the first two days, it seemed like the essence of Loureiro on the third day. As much as I preferred the library versions this issue for drinking now, here is an example of how delicious and exciting they can be when young, too. In that regard, this is built to age and we might have to wait a few years to be sure how truly great it is. If you don't know top-end Vinho Verde and Ameal, you may be shocked at that. This will become more complex and (I suspect) flesh out over the next few years. It is, if anything, a bit too aggressive just now. You get this amazing value only because owner Pedro Araújo labors in Vinho Verde, where the top wines are undervalued. Take advantage.

The wine has a fabulous texture, a plush, full-bodied mouthfeel, and beautiful purity and depth.

One of the island's benchmarks, this is always in fine form these day-and always rather hard to evaluate when it is young. Deceptively, this bottling doesn't seem intimidating on first taste, but it always hides many layers. I tend to decant them or taste them again the next day when they are young. Otherwise, you tend to miss too much. Wonderfully elegant and finishing with a salty nuance, this shows impeccable balance. Its best feature is the lingering and intense finish, with plenty of tension and grip. It has far more power than it seems on a casual sip and that power doesn't go away as the wine airs and warms. I tried it the next day, in fact, and it put on weight, absorbed the salt and showed even more power. Two days later, it still preened in its power and precision, fresh as a daisy and wholly unevolved. (The salt was back, too.) The gripping finish that coated the palate was simply impressive. This is another beauty from Sigalas, something that has a lot of upside potential still. Granting that I do not have them side by side, this might even be superior to the 2015. It's hard to overlook the superlative combination of concentration and intensity. If nothing else, it is a worthy competitor to the 2015 and fully its equal. While I am leaning up on it today, it is all about the potential as not many whites are this tightly wound. Try this again at the beginning summer 2019, and you will no doubt have a better experience. You can dive in now, if you insist, but I suspect this may not be fully expressive until 2020 or so. It should also age effortlessly, but let's start here and take the rest in stages. I won't be shocked if handles 20 years or more well, but let's be conservative for the moment.""",25.99

Simply put, this is an outrageously beautiful wine for the money. In most vintages, the Langhe Nebbiolo is a combination of fruit from Vajra's estate in Sinio (more on that in a bit) plus declassified lots of the Barolos. In 2014, most of the fruit is from the Sinio property. If you ask old-timers (you have to go back 1-2 generations), grapes from Sinio were often used for the production of Barolo. The fruit sees a short fermentation in steel meant to emphasize freshness, but I have no doubt that if the Vajras wanted to, they could make a Barolo-level wine from this fruit.
